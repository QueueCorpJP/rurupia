# Fix Test Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TinyMCE API Key Issue
- **Problem**: TinyMCE editor was showing as read-only due to missing API key from edge function
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `get-tinymce-key` edge function that fetches key from admin_settings table
  - Added fallback to environment variables
  - Improved TinyMCE configuration to ensure editor is not read-only
  - Added proper setup functions to force editable mode

### 2. Comment Dialog Scrolling Issue  
- **Problem**: When clicking on comments in therapist posts, dialog would scroll to top and close when scrolling down to see input field
- **Solution**:
  - Modified comment dialog/drawer `onOpenChange` handlers to prevent accidental closing
  - Added `overscrollBehavior: 'contain'` to prevent parent scrolling
  - Improved dialog structure with proper flex layout and overflow handling
  - Added modal=true for desktop dialogs to prevent background interaction

### 3. Review Count Display Issue
- **Problem**: Therapist detail page showing zero reviews even when reviews exist
- **Solution**:
  - Improved review count fetching to use both `therapists.review_count` and direct count from `therapist_reviews` table
  - Added fallback logic to ensure accurate count display
  - Added proper error handling and logging

## Database Status Check

The database shows:
- Therapist "たけし" has 1 review properly reflected in review_count field
- TinyMCE API key is stored in admin_settings table
- Edge function is deployed and active

## Test Steps

1. **TinyMCE Test**:
   - Go to admin blog page
   - Verify TinyMCE editor loads without "read-only" error
   - Verify you can type and edit content

2. **Comment Dialog Test**:
   - Go to therapist posts
   - Click on comment icon
   - Verify dialog opens without scrolling to top
   - Scroll within dialog to see input field
   - Verify dialog doesn't close when scrolling
   - Test adding a comment

3. **Review Count Test**:
   - Go to therapist detail page for "たけし" 
   - Verify review count shows "1" not "0"
   - Check other therapists with reviews
